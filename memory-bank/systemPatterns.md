# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
- Asynchronous scraping engine using Python's asyncio
- Modular design with separate components for scraping, memory management, and logging
- Domain-specific scraping rules and configurations

## Key Components
1. Scraper Core
   - Main scraping engine
   - Handles HTTP requests and response parsing
   - Manages concurrent scraping tasks

2. Memory Bank
   - Tracks scraping progress
   - Prevents duplicate work
   - Stores intermediate results

3. Logger
   - Records scraping activities
   - Handles error logging
   - Provides debugging information

## Design Patterns
- Factory pattern for creating domain-specific scrapers
- Observer pattern for progress monitoring
- Strategy pattern for different scraping approaches

## Implementation Paths
1. URL Processing
   - Validate and normalize URLs
   - Handle different URL formats
   - Manage URL queues

2. Content Extraction
   - Parse HTML content
   - Extract structured data
   - Handle dynamic content

3. Data Storage
   - Store extracted data
   - Track progress
   - Handle errors and retries
